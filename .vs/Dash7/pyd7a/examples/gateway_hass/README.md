# Gateway for connection between DASH7 and Home Assistant
This example sets up a connection with home assistant using mqtt. It uses autodiscovery to provision new devices and uses custon files as data.

This example is meant for the Push7 board (soon commercially available) but can be expanded for other files/data.
